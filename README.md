Rogue-EVE
---

My very own Rogue like game :D

It is based on RogueBasin python3+tdl roguelike tutorial, 
using object oriented pratices to make the game easier to expand 
and develop.

## Ideas
* *SNEAK and Torches* - Thinking of using the tdl visible stuff to add torches... 
I could add sneak properties and do a roguelike of the game card thief, 
could be a good change in the game pace.

* *Many dungeon types* - Add system to create many types for dungeons.

* *Random Parallel Learning*

* *Hero or Zero*

* *Diverse Tools & Making Do*

* *Competing Objectives & Strategic Commitment*

* *Variety not Random*
